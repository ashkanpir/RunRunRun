# Runkeeper Running Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing personal running data collected from the Runkeeper app, a popular GPS fitness tracker. The goal is to gain insights into running styles, training habits, and performance trends over time. The analysis includes data extraction, cleaning, visualization, and interpretation of key running metrics.

## Key Features
- **Data Import and Review:** Loads raw running data exported from Runkeeper, reviewing the structure and content to understand the available metrics.
- **Performance Analysis:** Analyzes various aspects of running performance, such as pace, distance, frequency, and trends over time.
- **Visualization:** Uses visualizations to explore relationships between different training metrics and to track progress towards fitness goals.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Main programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations that illustrate performance trends and insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment used for conducting and presenting the analysis.

## Data
- The dataset includes running metrics exported from the Runkeeper app, such as distance, pace, duration, elevation, and more. Data is processed to derive meaningful insights about running habits and performance.

## Results
- The analysis provides insights into running performance, highlighting patterns in training habits and suggesting areas for improvement.
- Visualizations help in understanding trends over time, such as changes in pace or distance, and the impact of different training strategies.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Run the notebook to reproduce the analysis and explore the visualizations.
